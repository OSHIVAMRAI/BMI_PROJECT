      <p> Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI 
          is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally 
          expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.

        The BMI may be determined using a table[note 1] or chart which displays BMI as a function of mass 
        and height using contour lines or colours for different BMI categories, and which may use other 
        units of measurement (converted to metric units for the calculation).[note 2]
        
        The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as underweight, normal 
        weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. Commonly 
        accepted BMI ranges are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 25), overweight (25 
        to 30), and obese (over 30).[1]
        
        BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-causes mortality, with the risk 
        increasing with distance from the 20â€“25 range.[2]
        BMI provides a simple numeric measure of a person's thickness or thinness, allowing health 
        professionals
         to discuss weight problems more objectively with their patients. BMI was designed to be used as a 
         simple means of classifying average sedentary (physically inactive) populations, with an average 
         body composition.[9] For such individuals, the value recommendations as of 2014 are as follows: a 
         BMI from 18.5 up to 25 kg/m2 may indicate optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the 
         person is underweight, a number from 25 up to 30 may indicate the person is overweight, and a 
         number from 30 upwards suggests the person is obese.[7][8] Lean male athletes often have a high 
         muscle-to-fat ratio and
         therefore a BMI that is misleadingly high relative to their body-fat percentage.[8]</p>
